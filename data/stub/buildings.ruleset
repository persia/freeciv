; Below: The individual buildings, one per section.
; (Buildings = City Improvements and Wonders)
;
; The actual tag used (the * in [building_*]) does not matter, except
; it must be unique within this file, and it may be used in debug
; output when reading this file.
;
; Notes:
;
; name		= name as seen by user 
; genus	        = genus; one of:
;                 "GreatWonder", "SmallWonder", "Improvement", "Special".
; reqs		= requirements to build the building (see effects.ruleset
;		  and README.effects for help on requirements)
; graphic	= icon of improvement (used in city dialog)
; graphic_alt	= alternate icon of improvement
; obsolete_by	= requirements for the building to become obsolete
; build_cost	= production shields required to build
; upkeep	= monetary upkeep value
; sabotage	= percent chance of diplomat sabotage being successful
; flags         = special flag strings
;
; ** Building flags **
; "VisibleByOthers"  = Anyone who can see your city knows whether it has
;                      this improvement. (Great and small wonders are
;                      always visible.)
; "SaveSmallWonder"  = If you lose the city with this building in, and the
;                      "savepalace" server setting is enabled, another will
;                      be built for free in a random city.
;                      Should only be used with genus "SmallWonder".
; "Gold"             = Not a real building; production turned into gold
;                      indefinitely (capitalization/coinage).
;                      Genus should be "Special".
; "DisasterProof"    = Disasters never destroy this building. Is meaningful
;                      only for genus "Improvement" buildings as others are
;                      automatically disaster proof.
