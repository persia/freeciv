;
; A specialist is a city citizen who is not a tile worker.  Usually the
; player can control what specialist each citizen is, so long as the
; requirements for that specialist are met.
;
; Below are the entries for the specialists, one per specialist type.
; The tag name (in [specialist_*]) doesn't matter so long as it's unique.
; For each specialist the following fields may be set:
;
;
; name          = translatable (plural) name as seen by user
; rule_name     = (optional) name for savegames, rulesets etc; if not
;                 present, 'name' is used. Since the name used in savegames
;                 must not change, this is used when renaming a specialist
;                 after a ruleset has been released. (The original specialist
;                 names in the default ruleset were not designed to be
;                 user-visible.)
; short_name    = one-character "short name" used (for instance) in cityrep;
;                 should be first character/abbrevation of "name"
; graphic_alt   = fallback graphic tag in case the specialist graphic isn't
;                 found. Example value: "specialist.scientist_0"
;                 The specialist graphic allow different images based on
;                 citizen number. The alt tag don't. To use another
;                 specialist's tag use specialist.<otherrulename>_<number>.
; reqs          = requirements to have the specialist pick (see
;                 effects.ruleset and README.effects for help on requirements)
; helptext      = optional help text string; should escape all raw newlines
;                 so that xgettext parsing works
;
