Sandbox Ruleset
===============

History
-------

Sandbox ruleset started out as a copy of civ2civ3 ruleset as it stood
in Freeciv 2.6 (civ2civ3 is Freeciv's default ruleset starting from
version 3.0).
The former ruleset for testing unusual features of the freeciv engine
was called 'Experimental' and based on classic ruleset that was
the default ruleset earlier. As the default ruleset changed, we felt
the need to base also the testing ruleset to the new default.


Main features relative to civ2civ3 ruleset
------------------------------------------

Nuke Upkeep:
If nuke upkeep cannot be paid, they explode in place.

Airlifting:
Light weight units can be airlifted once Flight is known. Medium weight
units can be airlifted once Advanced Flight is known. Heavy weight units
can be airlifted once Fusion Power is known.
To airlift heavy and medium weight units an airport is required both in
the source and in the destination city.
Cities that know Flight can airlift one light weight unit per turn. An
Airport allows a city to airlift one more unit per turn.

Map Stealing:
Spies can steal other player's world map

Border Vision:
Border Vision is gained mid-game once Electricity is known

Allied Wonder Building:
One can help allies to build wonder.

Destroy City:
Leader unit can destroy domestic cities.

Unit Expulsion:
Foreign units can be expelled from the territory of a player.

Paradropping:
It's impossible for green Paratroopers to land on Forest and Jungle
tiles. Veteran, hardened and elite Paratroopers can still do it.

Unit Disbanding:
A unit can be Disbandable, Undisbandable or ConsensusUndisbandable. The
consensus among the player's bureaucracy is that ConsensusUndisbandable
units never should be disbanded (or recycled). Under some governments it
has the power to enforce its will.
The unit types Battleship and Carrier are ConsensusUndisbandable. Both unit
types gets an Easter Egg in their ruleset comments: a reference to a news
paper article indicating that ConsensusUndisbandable isn't a completely
fictional concept.

Single Barbarian Nation:
All barbarians belong to the same barbarian nation. There's no separate
Pirates and (land) Barbarians.

Hermit's Place:
Hermit's places are spontaneously, during game, appearing bonus extras
that can grant techs to units exploring them. See its Help entry under
Terrains for more information.

Sea Units in port:
Sea Units in cities defend with 1/4 of their usual defense value.

Goods:
Trade routes can carry many kinds of goods. There is production chains
like that city with Mine can trade Ore to a city that then can trade
Metal to third city which can then trade Goods or Equipment to fourth
city. Goods later in chains trade for higher value.

Corruption and World Size:
Under Republic government, the speed corruption increases as one goes
further from the capital is relative to the size of the world. At
the maximum distance corruption is the same regardless of the size of
the world.

Explorers establishing embassies:
Explorers can establish embassies once Writing is known. The Explorer
unit is used up by this.

Establish Embassy from sea:
Units can establish embassies directly from boats without
disembarking.

Units can be bribed/sabotaged if not alone on their tile:
Being part of a unit stack won't protect against spy actions.

Merchant movement restrictions:
Caravans and Freight can only moves on roads and rivers (as in older
versions of civ2civ3).

One-time trade bonuses:
Caravans and Freight get one-time bonuses when establishing trade
routes, and can get revenue even when a trade route exists
('Enter Marketplace'), as in older versions of civ2civ3; however,
this latter action really requires a Marketplace building in the city.

Custom policy "Personal Freedom":
You can trade off a science bonus against extra unhappiness from your
aggressive military units.

Border stealing:
The workable tiles next to a city are permanently within the city
owner's borders, once claimed. The outer workable tiles can be stolen
by a city with greater influence.

Opponents not seeing units in fortress or airbase:
Opponents can't see units that are inside fortress or airbase.
Units inside fort and airstrip can still be seen.
