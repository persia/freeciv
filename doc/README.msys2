 MSYS2 Windows Installer build notes
====================================

This document is about building Freeciv Windows Installer packages
using MSYS2 from http://msys2.github.io


 Status
====================================

- Msys1, not msys2, is still the official freeciv Windows Installer
  build method
- Buildable clients are gtk3, gtk2, sdl2, and Qt
  - Official pre-made msys2 environment supports only gtk3-client build


 Setup
====================================

 This chapter is about creating new msys2 build environment.

 If you want to reproduce more official freeciv builds, the environment
 used to make those builds is documented in the next chapter ("Premade environment"),
 with listing of versions current at the time of this freeciv version.

1) Install MSYS2 following the documentation on their homepage

1.1) Download
 https://sourceforge.net/projects/msys2/files/Base/i686/msys2-i686-20160205.exe
 for win32 or
 https://sourceforge.net/projects/msys2/files/Base/x86_64/msys2-x86_64-20160205.exe
 for win64

1.2) Run it to install MSYS2 on build system

1.3) Launch msys2_shell to update packages
> pacman -Syu

2) Install following packages with 'pacman -Su'
   As of 22-Sep-16, one has to use also '--force' option.

2.1) Packages needed for building freeciv
 These packages are needed even if you don't plan to make installer,
 but only build freeciv for local use.

2.1.1) Arch independent packages needed for building freeciv

2.1.1.1) Arch independent packages always needed for building freeciv
 With these packages it's possible to build freeciv source tree that
 has already such generated files present that are created for the
 release tarball.

 - make
 - gettext
 - pkg-config

2.1.1.2) Arch independent packages needed for getting and extracting freeciv
 source tarball

 - tar

2.1.1.3) Arch independent packages needed for building freeciv from svn checkout
 These are needed in addition to the ones always needed for building freeciv.

 - subversion
 - automake
 - libtool
 - autoconf
 - python

2.1.2) Arch-specific packages needed for building freeciv

2.1.2.1) Arch-specific packages for building common parts
 - mingw-w64-i686-gcc / mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc
 - mingw-w64-i686-icu / mingw-w64-x86_64-icu
 - mingw-w64-i686-curl / mingw-w64-x86_64-curl
 - mingw-w64-i686-bzip2 / mingw-w64-x64_64-bzip2
 - mingw-w64-i686-readline / mingw-w64-x86_64-readline
 - mingw-w64-i686-SDL2_mixer / mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2_mixer

2.1.2.2) Arch-specific packages for building gtk3-client
 - mingw-w64-i686-gtk3 / mingw-w64-x86_64-gtk3

2.1.2.3) Arch-specific packages for buildind Qt-client and/or Ruledit
 - mingw-w64-i686-qt5 / mingw-w64-x86_64-qt5

2.1.2.4) Arch-specific packages for building gtk2-client
 - mingw-w64-i686-gtk2 / mingw-w64-x86_64-gtk2

2.1.2.5) Arch-specific packages for building sdl2-client
 - mingw-w64-i686-SDL2_image / mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2_image
 - mingw-w64-i686-SDL2_ttf / mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2_ttf
 - mingw-w64-i686-SDL2_gfx / mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2_gfx

2.2) Packages needed for building installer package
 These are needed in addition to above ones used in the
 building step already.

2.2.1) Arch-specific packages needed for building installer
 package

 - mingw-w64-i686-nsis / mingw-w64-x86_64-nsis

2.3) Packages TODO:

 - MagickWand support


 Premade environment
====================================

Premade msys2 environment is available for download from
http://download.gna.org/freeciv/packages/windows/testing/cazfi/installer_msys2/envs/

Current version is

win64 host:
-----------
msys2-freeciv-win64-160922.7z, based on
https://sourceforge.net/projects/msys2/files/Base/x86-64/msys2-x86_64-20160921.exe

Only win64 target is included - replace <arch> with 'x86_64' in package names below


Following packages have been installed:
- make
- pkg-config
- tar
- subversion
- patch
- nano
- automake
- libtool
- autoconf
- python
- mingw-w64-<arch>-gcc
- mingw-w64-<arch>-icu
- mingw-w64-<arch>-curl
- mingw-w64-<arch>-sqlite3
- mingw-w64-<arch>-gtk3
- mingw-w64-<arch>-nsis
- mingw-w64-<arch>-bzip2
- mingw-w64-<arch>-readline
- mingw-w64-<arch>-SDL2_mixer
- mingw-w64-<arch>-SDL2_image
- mingw-w64-<arch>-SDL2_ttf
- mingw-w64-<arch>-SDL2_gfx
- mingw-w64-<arch>-qt5


 Build
====================================

Launch msys2 shell. Get the freeciv sources there
somehow. Some options are:
1) Download freeciv tarball within msys2 shell with wget
2) Use svn within msys2 shell to get them from version control
3) Copy them from Windows folder where they are to a directory that
   is within msys2

> cd win32/installer_msys2
> make <targets>

  Target can be:
  - "<gui>-installer", where <gui> is
     - gtk3
     - gtk2
     - sdl2
     - qt
  - "ruledit-installer"
  - "snapshot", if your freeciv sources are in svn checkout directory

 You can also set minimum Windows version targeted. While setting this
 to an older version allows those Windows versions to run the created
 executables, it may come with the cost of disabling functionality that
 newer Windows versions could otherwise have.
 The version is set via MIN_WIN_VER variable. For values to use, see
 list in: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6sehtctf.aspx
 Current default is 0x0600 (Windows Vista).


 Problems
====================================

- Freeciv linked against readline in msys2 does not work.
  Configure freeciv with --without-readline


 TODO
====================================

- Readline support
