Sources here are fron luasql git tag v2.3.2
(https://github.com/keplerproject/luasql/tree/v2.3.2)

Only the files needed by freeciv are included here, not entire luasql
source directory hierarchy.
The ls_*.h files are our own additions to use those backends directly.
Changes applied to included luasql source files are included in
freeciv_luasql.patch
